    "It was the fifth day since being entrapped in this virtual world."
    
    kir "I'm hungry."
    
    "Her [[Private Message] came while I was in the middle something.  I couldn't reply as I was forced to take a hit at that instant."
    
    kyo "Ouch."
    
    "I was both impressed and annoyed at how quickly the game's difficulty increased.  For one, it took a long time to reach the next level.  For another, the monsters seemed to have twice as much health with each level increase."
    
    "«Horizontal»"
    
    "With a large sweep, my blade cut into the side of my opponent.  The [[Mad Cow] let out a bellow of pain before it charged again."
    
    "I barely broke free of the cooldown period in time to leap out of the way as the [[Mad Cow] rushed past."
    
    kir "Didn't you hear?  I'm hungry."
    
    "Ignoring her, I stared at the mad cow as it pawed at the ground."
    
    "Once."
    
    "Twice."
    
    "On the third strike, the cow charged forward again.  At the same time, I held the sword over my head and initiated another sword skill."
    
    "«Cross-Cut»"
    
    "My blade made a loud whoosh as it sliced vertically again.  The cow was not close enough for this slash to hit.  I felt the blade lift itself into the air and position itself to my right."  
    
    "There was a second whoosh and the sound of my sword striking something before the sound of bells tinkling entered the air."
    
    "I had no time to stare at my empty hands as I was thrown off my feet once again."
    
    "Losing health as I skidded to a halt, I quickly rolled out of the way as a hoof landed right where I had stopped."
    
    "Shooting to my feet, I looked around and sighed with relief as I had not grabbed the attention of a nearby [[Mad Cow].  One was already difficult to deal with.  Two would be a nightmare."
    
    kir "Hungry!  Where are you?!"
    
    "I ignored her again as I ran away while opening up my bag.  A carbon copy of my previous sword materialized in my hand as my opponent approached."
    
    "It was almost dead.  This should be it."
    
    "«Cross-Cut»"
    
    "This time, both cuts bit deeply into the cow's hide."
    
    "Unable to stop, the [[Mad Cow]'s momentum took it past me where it crashed to the ground."
    
    "Bells filled the air again, this time signalling that my opponent had died and not my sword."
    
    "I shakily took a few breaths.  That hadn't been good fight."
    
    "In the future, I would discover that I should have finished off the monster normally instead of using my best «Sword Skill».  But until that happened, I would repeat this mistake over and over again."
    
    kyo "Okay, that's done.  Looks like that was the 20th one.  Guess I'll get the other 30 to-"
    
    "That was when I felt the ground shake."
     
    "......"
    
    "Turning, I quickly spotted the new cow that had appeared in the pasture.  [[The Angry Bull]. It was taller than me, looked far stronger than me, and it had three health bars."
    
    "When it turned toward me, I did what anyone would have done in that situation."  
    
    "I ran for it."
    
    "I think by the time they finally broke off, I had 6 [[Mad Cows] and 1 [[The Angry Bull] chasing after me."
    
    
    # Scene break
    
    kir "Took you long enough."
    
    "She met me outside of the gate."
    
    kyo "Sorry."
    
    "I quickly brought up a trade window.  With the practice of five days experience behind it, I quickly transferred items to Kirino for her to sell."
    
    "From her pleased look, it looks like today's haul was good enough to defuse her anger."
    
    
    
    kir "And so, and so...  She was so cute!  Y'know?"
    
    "We were returning from the item shop and Kirino was telling me about the latest little sister that she had helped."
    
    # insert a hook for Silica?
    
    
    "We soon found ourselves inside of the inn."
    
    "Order something for me to eat and bring it to the room. I am going to go get changed for bed while you get the food." 

    "Kirino promptly disappeared up the stairs to our room, preventing me from raising a hint of a protest."
    
    "I stopped in front of the innkeeper and glanced at the menu nearby."
    
    kyo "Could I order the dinner set?"
    
    "Innkeeper" "Coming right up."
    
    "A sizzling sound seemed to fill the air as I waited.  A few seconds later, there was a ding behind the innkeeper."
    
    "I watched as the innkeeper opened the dumbwaiter and pulled out a covered serving tray."
     
    "The innkeeper then lifted the lid and revealed the requested meal, a steaming platter of turkey and vegetables."
    
    "Taking it, I stowed it away in my inventory as I prepared to order again."
    
    kyo "What kind of sister bosses her brother around like that? It just has to be a criminal act."
    
    $kuronekoname = "?"

    kuro "The only criminal act is you letting that brute of a girl tell you what to do nii-san." #A condescending voice said next to me. 
    
    kyo "As true as that is, I was the one who asked her to play this game with me. It's my fault that she is trapped her so I might as well make her as comfortable as possible." 
    
    kuro "So that is why nii-san is putting up with her?"
    
    "It soon occurred to me that I wasn't alone.  And whoever was with me sounded very familiar.  Curious, I turned around."
    
    #(Remove?)"Wait a minute. Nii-san.? It can't be. As I turned around I was greeted by a site I thought would be
    
    "Impossible!" #Kuroneko was standing right next to me with a proud grin."
    
    kyo "K-Kuroneko? What are you doing here? How did you get here?"
    
    kuro "I came here for a room obviously. As for how I got here, I walked."
    
    kyo "No no, how come you're playing this game?"
    
    kuro "?"
    
    "There was a long pause before she slowly closed her eyes and gave a slight nod."
    
    kuro "I believe that I understand."
    
    kuro "Saori wanted to play.  And she had somehow convinced me to come along."
    
    kyo "Saori too?"
    
    kuro "Unfortunately, she could not make it.  She gave me a NervGear unit and told me to try it out first before showing her how to play when she logged in later."
    
    kyo "...then Saori is-"
    
    kuro "I am unsure about your unnatural fixation with Saori..."
          
    kuro "...However..."
    
    kuro "...since we are unable to log out until we reach the top floor, I believe that the reverse should hold true as well."
    
    kuro "As a result, Saori will not be able to join us until we beat this game.  I hope you are not too disappointed."
    
    kyo "What?  No, I'm happy that she's okay.  But...hold on...hmm..."
    
    "I groped around for the best way to say this."
    
    kuro "?"
    
    kyo "Kirino is in the bedroom right now.  Would you like to join us?"
    
    "The look on her face seemed to say \"as expected\" and \"what a pervert\"?  Ah jeez.  I hurriedly tried to clarify what I had just said."
    
    kyo "I mean, you are going to stay with us now that you found us, right?"
    
    kuro "...I'm afraid that I must decline.  It would not be proper for me to enter a stranger's room."
    
    kyo "Stranger?  We've known each other for months now.  You've even visited our house.  What changed?"
    
    kuro "...Did I now?  I'm afraid that you must be mistaken.  I distinctly recall that this is our first time meeting each other."
    
    "I could almost swear that a hint of a smirk flashed across her face for a moment there."
    
    kyo "Ha ha ha."
    
    kuro "I aim to please."
    
    kyo "Still, it'd be nice if you joined us upstairs."
    
    kuro "Hmm...If nii-san wants me so badly then I can't refuse."
            
    kyo "Please don't give people the wrong idea." #I said while sighing. 
    
    kuro "Is that so?  I wasn't the one asking a girl to join me in the bedroom where another girl was waiting."
    
    kyo "You know that wasn't what I meant. I think Kirino will be much happier if you stay with us. You can stay in our room if you want." #I said completely forgetting the fact that there is only one bed.
    
    kuro "So my joining is just for Kirino's sake?"
    
    kyo "And mine too."
    
    kuro "Oh?"
    
    "She narrowed her eyes at me as if searching for something before she nodded."
    
    kuro "Very-"
    
    "Text filled the air in front of me"
    
    kuro "-Well."
    
    "I gave Ruri a large grin before I looked down at the message that I had just received."
    
    kir "What's taking you so long?!"
    
    kyo "Looks like we should go."
    
    "At her nod.  I was about to walk off when I noticed the tray innocently sitting on the counter.  Stashing the meal away in my inventory, I started to lead the way before I paused midstep."
    
    "Turning around, I quickly walked up to the bartender."
    
    kyo "I'd like to make an order."
    
    "A menu quickly appeared in the air before me."
    
    kyo "What would you like, Kuroneko?  It's my treat."
    
    kuro "..."
    
    kyo "?"
    
    kuro "...set 1."
    
    kyo "One Fried Fish set please."
    
    "I turned back to her."
    
    kyo "Anything else?"
    
    "She shook her head no."
    
    "The meal appeared just as quickly as the others.  When Kuroneko made no move to take the meal, I quickly stashed it away in my inventory."
    
    "Now that the food is taken care of, it's time to give my dear sister her meal."
    
    kyo "This way."
    
    "Ruri nodded again and followed behind me."
    
    
    #Scene change
    
    "I stopped at the open door and looked inside.  Kirino was lying on the bed looking through her inventory.  She stopped and glanced over as I stepped inside."
    
    kir "You took forever. What took you so long? Didn't I tell you I was starving?" # Kirino spouted off as soon as I stepped through the door. 
    
    kyo "Sorry, sorry, but I have really good news."
    
    kir "It'd better be important."
    
    kyo "It is.  We have a guest who will be staying with us from now on."
    
    kir "Like I care.  Where's the food alrea- THE BLACK ONE?!"
    
    "Kuroneko entered the room."
    
    kuro "Are you, perhaps, referring to me?"
    
    kir "Who else would I be referring to?!"
    
    kuro "...I would not attempt to understand the inner thoughts of a delusional fool.  But if I must guess..."
    
    "She looked around for a moment before pointing at the wall next to her."
    
    kir "...?"
    
    "Kuroneko pointed at the wall again."
    
    kir "..."
    
    "Kuroneko continued pointing at the wall."
    
    kir "What the heck are you doing?"
    
    kuro "You can't tell?  I've been pointing at the wall."
    
    kir "...what?"
    
    kuro "The wall.  Get it?"
    
    kir "...get...what?"
    
    "Kuroneko sighed and shook her head in a disappointed manner."
    
    kuro "I can see that you don't.  As expected of you."
    
    kir "What does that mean?!"
        
    "Kirino jumped from the bed and stomped over."
    
    "Oh lord, they do not need to start fighting right now.  I mean we just found each other again.  What were the chances of that?"
    
    "Before I could stop them, I saw Kirino lunge at our guest.  Punches immediately?!  No shouting at all?"
    
    "Kuroneko must have been as shocked as I was, as she made no move to dodge as the my sister basically landed on her."
    
    "Silence filled the air."
    
    "Then a choked sob came from the girl on top."
    
    kuro "Calm down you stupid beast. Refined beings don't show such emotions in front of others." #Kuroneko said with her eyes starting to water as well. 
    
    "Kuroneko's eyes were starting to water as well as she struggled to push my sister off of her."
    
    "Kirino did not say much more than that as tears started freely flowing down her face."
    
    "I could only stare helplessly as the two girls started crying."
     
    "Feeling like I was intruding in an uncomfortable moment, I turned away and found interest in a nearby wall."
    
    "When the tears finally stopped, I could feel the stares of two girls upon me."
    
    "Faking a few coughs, I pulled the meals from my inventory before I turned to them."
    
    kyo "Let's eat?"
    
    "Kuroneko / Kirino" "Insensitive / Idiot."
    
    "Figures."
    
    
    # Scene change
    
    "After dinner, the two girls proceeded to chat.  Faced with nothing better to do, I pulled brought up a chess minigame that I had found under one of the menu options."
    
    "I was losing pretty badly when I realized that I was being stared at again."
    
    "Can I help you?"
    
    kir "Get off.  I'm going to bed."
    
    "I'm not sure how I found myself sitting on the bed in the first place, but it seems like my ungrateful sister wanted me off."
    
    "However, as my eyes flickered to our guest, I suddenly knew that I had forgotten something."
    
    "Namely, sleeping arrangements."
    
    kuro "Nii-san where am I going to sleep?" #Kuroneko asked me piercing my eyes with her own. 
    
    kyo "Ah, well about that. We only have one bed and Kirino is already sleeping there. I suppose you can take my spot on the floor. It has the extra blanket and pillows so it should be comfortable." #I said thinking that would be the logical choice.
    
    kir "Idiot. Why should she sleep on the floor. She will sleep on the other side of the bed. I don't mind sharing for one night."
    
    "She makes it sound like that was the only right choice in the world."
    
    kuro "So nii-san has to sleep on the hard floor? Sob. sob. Such a cruel little sister you are. Shouldn't you offer your nice older brother a spot on the bed so he can sleep comfortably?" 
    
    "She actually said sob sob?!"  
    
    kir "A-Are you suggesting he sleep with us? As in the same bed?" # Kirino sputtered out, her face instantly blossoming a deep crimson.
    
    kuro "Of course. We wouldn't be doing anything naughty now would we nii-san?" 
    
    "I gulped and stood there shaking my head."
    
    kuro "See he wouldn't do anything. So will you let your poor nii-san sleep with us?"
    
    kir "F-Fine, but if he does anything I'll kill him. I swear." #Kirino said in a small voice as she got into the bed  and turned away.
    
    kuro "Good. Now nii-san you get in." # Kuroneko said, a glint in her eyes.
    
    kyo "Um, I think I should be on the end." #I replied thinking of how Kirino would probably kick me if I accidentally touched her in my sleep.
    
    kuro "Nonsense, now get in there." 
    
    "I steeled myself for the worst and carefully got into the bed when the worst possible thing for me happened. My finger accidentally brushed against Kirino's back."
    
    "When I did not instantly receive reprimanding I continued settling down until I was comfortable." 
    
    kuro "Ku ku ku. Now it's my turn." #Kuroneko gleefully said as
    
    "She practically dived into the bed and snuggled up to my arm. As much as I cursed my luck, I could not dispute the fact that this was indeed rather nice." 
    
    "Granted, who would not find being in bed with a teen model and a cute loli wonderful? Just before I fell into oblivion I could feel another pair of arms grasping onto my other arm and snuggling close to it."
    
    "I smile as I plunged into the dark abyss of sleep."
