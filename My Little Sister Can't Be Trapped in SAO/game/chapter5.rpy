    # Kuroneko has met Argo
    "?" "Neko-yan"
    
    "At the first sound of that voice, Kuroneko tensed."
    
    kuro "We have to go."
    
    "Before I could ask why, she was pulling me away."
    
    kir "Wha?!  Hey!"
    
    "We passed through a variety of throughways and alleyways before we stopped."
    
    kuro "What is your hiding level?"
    
    kyo "Hiding?  I don't have it."
    
    kuro "Tsk."
    
    argo "Aww.  So mean.  You don't have to run away."
    
    kuro "I have no business with you. Leave."
    
    argo "Is that any way to treat an old friend."
    
    kuro "Old Friend?  Hmmph, this is the third time.  I'd hardly call that well-acquainted."
    
    argo "Aww Neko-yan.  Haven't you heard.  There are moments that seem to last forever.  We had three of them."
    
    kuro "I recall no such moment."
    
    kyo "Uhh, what's going on?  Who are you talking to?"
    
    argo "That's my cue."
    
    "Just like that, a cloaked figure appeared.  The most distinguishing thing about this figure were the whiskers."
    
    "We stared at each other in silence."
    
    argo "...well?  Aren't you going to ask who I am?"
    
    kyo "...Who are you?"
    
    argo "Glad you asked.  The name's Argo.  I'm an information dealer."
    
    $ argoname = "Argo"
    
    argo "If you have a question, I might have an answer.  For a price, of course."
    
    kyo "...How do you know Kuroneko?"
    
    "She held out her hand."
    
    argo "10 col."
    
    "It wasn't much.  And I was genuinely curious."
    
    argo "Thank you for your patronage.  Okay then, she has a rapier now, but when I first saw her she was using throwing picks to defeat a boar."
    
    argo "Naturally, I was curious when she stopped throwing, pawed her belt several times, before shrieking as the boar crashed into her."
    
    kuro "I recall no such thing."
    
    argo "Nishishishi. It was so much fun watching her get up and try and kick the boar to death."
    
    kuro "Nn..."
    
    "Aside from the crafty chuckle, Argo gave no other sign of being interrupted."
    
    argo "Surprisingly, it worked.  The boar died after several kicks to the head.  But I wouldn't be too impressed.  Boars aren't known for being hard to kill."
    
    kuro "..."
    
    argo "Alas, it was probably a bad idea to approach her after the fight while telling her that I had seen everything."
    
    argo "When I tried to give her a beginner's weapon, she refused while informing me that the throwing picks were well-suited for her."
    
    argo "That made her interesting in my book.  As most players shy away from using throwing picks as their primary and only weapon since it is possible to RUN OUT."
    
    kuro "..."
    
    argo "That tip is free by the way.  Consider it a service."
    
    argo "So I poked at her a little more, and on the second visit, I finally got her name."
    
    kuro "A mistake that I shall soon rectify."
    
    argo "And that's how I found out about Neko-yan.  Nice job convincing her about the weapon."
    
    kyo "I didn't.  Sure, I might have told her that she might run out of throwing picks.  But she found the rapier herself."
    
    argo "Hmmm?  Hoh...Interesting, interesting.  Reminds me of someone else that I know."
    
    kyo "Huh?"
    
    argo "Nothing nothing.  May I get your name? For future reference, I have a feeling that we'll be seeing each other a few times in the future."
    
    kyo "Ky-guh"
    
    kuro "10000 col"
    
    argo "Oh?  Interesting kitty.  Looks like you want to play a game?  But let me tell you, this rat has taken down bigger creatures than a mere kitten."
    
    kuro "Hoh?  Big words from a thing that goes squeak."
    
    argo "Nishishishi.  I can see that I've overstayed my welcome here.  I must be off then.  Time is money after all."
    
    "I'm pretty sure that I was surprised when I saw her just vanish before us, as if by magic.  Before I could rein in my bewilderment, I thought I heard a faint whisper."
    
    argo "Try to rein in your girlfriend a little next time we meet? Nishishishi."
    
    "Huh?"
    
    kuro "One day...one day...The gods of Maschera will have their reven-"               # This is totally wrong.  Using it as a placeholder.
    
    kir "There you are!  What have you been up to?"
    
    kuro "Hmmph, if you really must know.  A little of this and a little of that."
    
    "While the statement itself was vague, the odd gestures that she used as she said it made all the difference between an innocent remark and something rather..."
    
    kir "W-W-What?!  Aniki!!  Y-Y-You..."
    
    kir "...Sick Perverted Masochistic Hentai Freak!"
    
    "Whaaaaaaat?!"              # A death bell sound

    "We found ourselves back in the wolf fields."
    
    "This time, however, we weren't alone.  Several of the wolves had gathered at the base of an old gnarled tree, snarling loudly."  
    
    "What could they be waiting for?  What few leaves were left on the tree failed to obscure them when we looked up."
    
    "There were two children struggling to stay away from the wolves.  Any moment now, it looks like the branch that they were standing on was going to break."
    
    kir "Oh my god!  She's perfect!"
    
    "Thanks to her shout, those at the scene turned to the newcomers, us."
    
    "?" "Onee-chan!  Save us!"
    
    "I blinked in surprise as a question mark appeared above the girl's head."
    
    "An NPC?"
    
    "Before I could say a word, Kirino was already fighting the wolves."
    
    "Kuroneko was a half-step behind her.  The black cat calmly stabbed at a the gaping jaws of a wolf that had decided to target her."
    
    "A quick glance showed that they were levels 5-7.  A bit tough with their banding, but nothing too dangerous."
    
    "With a loud cry, I leapt into the fray as well."
    
    # scene change
    
    "It wasn't long before we managed to defeat the wolves.  Kirino reached out and caught the girl as she jumped.  And then she tightly hugged her."
    
    "As for the boy, he was left to climb down."
    
    "When he reached the ground, he turned to us."
    
    "Thank you for saving us."
    
    
    # The boy and the girl were out to slay the big wolf that had been a danger to their village
    # If they failed at the minions.  The big wolf must be really tough.  
    # They want you to run away with them before the big one shows up.
    # The girl is sad.  Because the big wolf has already eaten their father.
    # Kirino promises to save them.
    # Instead, the boy says no.  Let's leave and get help from the village.
    # A question mark appears on both children's head.
    # They're going to fight?
    # 
    
    "boy" "You're really going to fight?"
    
    "boy" "Then take this."
    
    "The boy holds the sword out toward me."  
    
    "boy" "This was our father's.  It was returned to us...after..."
    
    "I dropped a heavy hand on his head."
    
    kyo "Stop right there.  You can't cry.  Not while there are girls here."
    
    "boy" "...Thank you.  I wish I could stay and help.  But I need to protect my sister right now.  You understand, right?"
    
    "My eyes flickered over to Kirino."
    
    kyo "...Yeah."
    
    "boy" "Take the sword.  If you run away now, I will not fault you.  You've done enough already. "
    
    "A distant bell seemed to chime in the distance.  A sign that something big was coming."
    
    kyo "Run!"
    
    "They did just that.  But before they disappeared, I heard the boy say one last thing."

    "boy" "If you get the chance, go west.  You'll find us in the village the-"
    
    "There was a loud crashing noise."
    
    kir "Flurry"
    
    "Kirino had already started to engage the large white wolf."
    
    "At least eight feet tall, it was at least 3 times larger than the wolves that we had been facing before."
    
    # Need to add in shouts during battle and healing.
    
    
    "White Alpha Wolf.  Level 8."
    
    "The two health bars clinched the toughness trophy."
    
    "Kirino slid to a halt next to me."
    
    kir "What the hell!  I hit it, but there's no damage."
    
    kuro "Special Skill: Night Fantastic."
    
    "What the?!"
    
    "My question was soon answered when Kuroneko chained together a vertical, a horizontal, to create a cross before stabbing forward three times with linears."
    
    "It was what she was calling that combination of sword arts.  But it did sound cool, and the short period of inactivity because of the rapier made it possible to chain them almost seamlessly."
    
    "She fell back, and I knew that was my cue."
    
    kyo "Sonic Leap."
    
    "It was big, and it was easy to hit."
    
    "And because of this, I carved an angry red line down the monster's side before rolling underneath its belly and coming out from the other side where I froze in place while the sword art finished cooling down."
    
    "I could feel it as the wolf turned to look at my backside.  And then I was forced to listen as the wolf howled loudly after our opening salvo.  The cooldown ended, and I could finally turn to face our foe."  
    
    "The battle had finally begun."
    
    kuro "I need to heal."
    
    "Hearing her, I shifted into a different sword stance and slashed down as hard as I could.  I was rewarded with a critical as I had managed to strike the wolf's neck."
    
    "And with that, I had the wolf turning toward me."
    
    kir "Stab!"
    
    kir "Flurry!"
    
    kir "Yaaaah!"
    
    "Kirino continued to slash mercilessly at the creature as I kept it distracted."
    
    "Moments later, the monster wolf suffered a stab to the throat.  A critical hit."
    
    "Kuroneko had returned after quaffing a healing potion.  Her health was slowly increasing as she resumed her own assault."
    
    "I managed to dodge out of the way of the Wolf's lunging tackle."
    
    kyo "Horizontal"
    
    kuro "Pain."
    
    "Kuroneko's second strike was also dead center, yielding a second critical.  She had regained the wolf's attention."
    
    "That was how the battle was going, Kuroneko and I were juggling the monster's attention while leaving Kirino continually struck at its blind spots."
    
    "So far, half of its first health bar had been removed and we were still going strong."
    
    kir "Is this all that it's got?"
    
    kuro "Heh, I should have soloed this myself if I had known it was this easy."
    
    "Despite their tough talk, I'm pretty certain all of us had a bad feeling."
    
    "It came halfway into the second health bar.  By then, we had been fighting it for about fifteen minutes and we were starting to become tired."
    
    "When the wolf stopped all of a sudden, we continued attacking while thinking that it had probably given up."
    
    "We probably should have fallen back.  Because we were very surprised when it howled again, this time louder than the first."
    
    "Before we knew it, small wolves began appearing from the forest.  While easy to take down, they continued to appear."
    
    kir "What?!"
    
    kir "Gyaaaah!"
    
    kuro "Ngh!"
    
    "And the big wolf was still there, and glowing red."
    
    "It stared at Kuroneko, causing her to take a step back."
    
    kuro "I don't like the look on its face."
    
    "That was when it charged.  She managed to leap out of the way in time, causing it to pass by harmlessly."
    
    "Skidding to a halt, it turned around and charged again.  I was surprised to see her flimsy blade actually turn the alter the charge's trajectory into a glancing blow."
    
    kuro "Ngh.  A little help here?!"
    
    "Taking advantage of its inattention as it passed by me, I swung, cutting deeply into the wolf's flank."
     
    "I was then forced to turn around and use a wide sweeping attack to knock away a small wolf that was creeping up on me from behind."
    
    "Kirino had her own problem.  Slashing multiple times, she succeeded in removing another wolf from the group of assailants.  However another one had appeared to take its place."
    
    kir "I'm busy!"
    
    kyo "Hang on!  I'll be right there!"
    
    "Kuroneko whirled around and managed to deflect the wolf's oncoming lunge again.  "
    
    kuro "Ngh!  Hurry up!  I need to heal!"
    
    "With another wide sweep, I finally got my opponent to back off enough for me to turn and do a flying leap strike right as the wolf slid to a halt."
    
    kyo "Sonic Leap."
    
    "I hit it.  But it continued lunging toward Kuroneko again.  And now I had to deal a pair of the small minions again while I stood there frozen in place after using a Sword Skill."
    
    kuro "What are you doing?!  Get its attention already!"
    
    kyo "I'm trying!"
    
    "Thankfully, Kirino chose that moment to run past, slashing at one of the wolves that had been attacking me while throwing a pick at the other."
    
    kir "Come on!"
    
    "She succeeded in seizing their attention as they broke off and began chasing her, freeing me up to attack the large wolf again."
    
    "The frozen timer on my display disappeared."
    
    "Rage Spike!"
    
    "Leaping forward, I delivered a light slash to the wolf, before my sword made a return trip upwards."
    
    "The wolf was momentarily stunned as my skill knocked its rear legs slightly off the ground, causing it to topple forward."
    
    "Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Kuroneko take the moment to materialize and quaff a potion."
    
    "She was in a guard stance a moment later, and the wolf stood up."
    
    "We now had a new strategy.  Kirino would distract the small wolves while Kuroneko distracted the large wolf."
    
    kyo "Vertical."
    
    "It was my turn to deal damage to the large wolf.  I hit the large wolf as hard as I could again.  Another small chunk of hp disappeared.  A few more hits..."
    
    "...I noticed that the Alpha Wolf had suddenly stopped looking for Kuroneko..."
    
    "...instead, it was staring at my sister."
    
    kyo "Crap."
    
    "I started running toward her as fast as I could."
    
    kir "Eh?!"
    
    "Already dealing with the little wolves, Kirino had no way to escape when the big wolf charged at her."
    
    "I managed to get there just in time for a numb feeling to shoot up my arm as one of its teeth the size of a dinner plate stabbed straight in."
    
    "Ah...it got me.  A glance upward and I saw that that one solid bite had put me in the red."
    
    "Kirino / Kuroneko" "Aniki! / Kyosuke!"
    
    "As the dream from last night came back to me, I could only think one thing..."
    
    "...Not this time!"
    
    "A pair of flashes lanced across my field of view, one of them across the wolf's eyes.  The other under the wolf's massive jaw."
    
    "It let out a long howl, allowing me to wrench my arm free with a sickening splurch and escape"
    
    "Regaining my bearings after the short drop to the ground, I noticed that an indicator showed that I was bleeding and losing health slowly."
    
    "Ignoring that, I got into a ready stance.  Kuroneko and Kirino appeared, grins on their faces."
    
    "Ready?"
    
    "At the pair of nods, I crouched down and prepared to use a sword skill to reach the alpha wolf first."
    
    "Rage Spike!"
    
    "The upward slash that followed the leap forward knocked the wolf's head upward.  Kuroneko was next."
    
    "Pain!"
    
    "With a single harsh stab, the wolf was yelping from the simulated pain to its foreleg.  Kirino took that chance to stab at the exposed throat."
    
    "Sharp Bite!"
    
    "Horizontal!"
    
    "At the same time, I was aiming my next shot at the exposed flank.  It hit."
    
    "Linear Dash!"
    
    "On the other side of the wolf, Kuroneko shot forward 4 meters within a second, carving through the monster's side."
     
    "Double Slash!"
    
    "Kirino had slid underneath and landed a pair of critical hits on the wolf's exposed stomach."
    
    "With adept agility granted to one with the (acrobat?) skill, she swung onto the wolf's back.  Raising her dagger high into the air, she waited for it to glow one more time..."
    
    "Backstab!"
    
    "Leaping off after delivering that last blow, she slid into place next to us before standing up."
    
    "The alpha wolf slowly collapsed, disappearing into a shower of polygons. Seeing their leader defeated, the small wolves slowly backed away while whimpering before turning around and running back into the forest."
    
    
    
    # scene change
    
    "It was after the battle."
    
    "All three of us couldn't help but turn to each other and grin.  Fighting a boss like that was a new experience from taking out the common monsters."
    
    "That last moment had been a bit rough.  But we managed to pull through."
    
    "And then my party members started panicking."
    
    kir "You're bleeding!"
    
    kuro "Bandage, bandage, bandage...."
    
    kir "There!  You just passed them!"
    
    kir "Higher!"
    
    kir "Lower!"
    
    kir "There there there!"
    
    kuro "Those are not bandages."
    
    "As my red health bar slowly continued to decrease, I watched quietly as both girls fretted over the Kuroneko's inventory in search of healing items."
    
    "Despite the seriousness of the situation, I felt the grin form on my face.  I couldn't lose here in this game.  Not for them."
