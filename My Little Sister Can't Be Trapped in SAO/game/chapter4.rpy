    kir "Y-Y-You can have more than two people in a party?!"
    
    "We both looked at Kirino.  It was Kuroneko that answered."

    "This wasn't good.  I had to change the subject."  
    
    kyo "Kuroneko, what kind of weapon do you use?"
    
    kuro "I use these throwing picks."  #She replied as she pulled out the aforementioned knives.
    
    kyo "Doesn't it seem strange to use something other than melee weapons in a game all about melee combat?"
                 
    kuro "Why would I want to carry a big cumbersome weapon as someone of my stature? These knives fit me perfectly."
    
    kyo "But what if you run out?"
    
    kuro "I haven't run out yet."
    
    kuro "But...I suppose I could use a dagger."
    
    "That was enough for me.  I went to Kirino, our party's resident dagger user."
    
    kyo "Can you spare a dagger?"
    
    kir "What?  Why?"
    
    kyo "Kuroneko might run out of throwing picks, so she'll need one when that happens."
    
    kir "...No way."
    
    "Giving a frustrated sigh, I tried to figure out how to solve this problem.  Wait.  What if..."
    
    "I opened up my inventory."
    
    "..."
    
    "Looks like I did have a junk dagger left over from yesterday's fighting."
    
    "Pulling it out, I held it out toward Kuroneko.  Only to have her shake her head no."
    
    kuro "I refuse to use the same weapon that the uncultured brute uses."
    
    kir "Hah!  As if I'd let you."
    
    "Here they go again.  Should I step in?"
    
    kuro "...You're right.  I'm not interested.  The weapon fits you perfectly.  Blunt.  Short.  Forgettable."
    
    kir "Wha?! A-A-At least I have a weapon."
    
    kuro "I do too."
    
    kir "But those will run out.  And they cause less damage than the dagger."
    
    kuro "Regrettably.  But they require skill to use.  Unlike a certain brute who wildly swings her dagger around while hoping to score a hit."

    kir "Speechless, huh?"
    
    kuro "...I'm level 5."
    
    kir "Wha?!  That's a lie!"
    
    "Instead of saying anything, Kuroneko pulled up her stat screen.  Grabbing one of the edges, she swivelled it around for us to see.  She wasn't kidding.  She really was level 5."
     
    "They both rounded on me."
    
    "Kirino / Kuroneko" "What level are you?"
    
    kyo "Uhh..."
    
    "What should I do?  If I tell the truth, Kirino will be mad at me.  I had to lie."        # We might be able to put a choice here.
    
    kyo "3"
    
    "Kuroneko immediately pointed at me."
    
    kuro "Show me."
    
    kyo "It's 3.  Don't you believe me?"
    
    kuro "I will when you show me."
    
    "Geh, this girl is perceptive."
    
    kir "He says it's 3 so it's 3.  Your demon levelling tendencies is making you delusional."
    
    kuro "Delusional?  I think not.  I was there when you were trading those items outside of the inn yesterday.  I find it very hard to believe that he could possibly be level 3."
    
    "Geh geh.  She was there since the inventory trade yesterday?!"
    
    kir "What's so hard to believe about it?!"
    
    kuro "When the bar says L-V-L-5, I'd say that him being level three is hard to believe."
    
    "Geh geh geh!  She saw my screen!  Wait, how good was her eyesight?!  I hadn't even known she was there."           # I think she was using hiding actually
    
    #this part needs more conflict
    
    kyo "Sorry Kirino, she's right.  I'm level five."
    
    kir "Wha?!"
    
    kuro "Kukuku, and so that leaves the undignified brute as the lowest level member of the group.  Why is your level so low?"
    
    kir "Ukiiiiii"
    
    kuro "Could it be.  Were you staying in the safety of the town while Onii-chan risked his life to level?"
    
    kir "Wha, no!"
    
    kuro "Could it be?  Were you relaxing while your Onii-chan worked hard to bring in money?"
    
    kir "No no!"
          
    "This could get bad fast.  Kuroneko was about to step on a landmine if this continued.  I had to end this before it was too late."
    
    kyo "It's not like that."
    
    kuro "Oh?"
    
    kyo "I didn't want her risking her life so I tricked her into staying behind the safety of the walls."
    
    kuro "Oh..."
    
    kir "What was that?!"
    
    "Stars filled my vision as I was slammed face first into the floor."
        
    kir "Did you think that I couldn't look after myself?!"
    
    kir "That I would be happy letting someone else sacrifice themselves while I live comfortably."
    
    kir "Stupid Aniki!"
    
    "She made her way to the door."
    
    kir "Let's go.  We've wasted enough time already."
    
    "The door slammed shut on her way out."
    
    "Kuroneko helped me up."
    
    kuro "Sorry."
    
    kyo "You didn't know.  Don't worry about it.  I'm glad that I could stop it before it was too late."
    
    kuro "Too late?"
    
    kyo "If you had managed to reach your conclusion, Kirino would have been upset at you.  Right now, she's just upset at me."
    
    kuro "I suppose..."
    
    kyo "But if you could help me..."
    
    kuro "..."
    
    kyo "I'd appreciate it if you continue to be her rival.  Right now, she's hiding it well.  But I think she's terrified of our current situation."

    kuro "As usual?  Of course.  You don't have to worry about a thing, Nii-san {image=emo_note}"

    kir "Here it comes!"
    
    "A loud roar similar to that of a jet engine filled the air before the worker bee suddenly seemed to vanish from its spot in midair."
    
    sndfx "Clang"
    
    kyo "Guh!"
    
    "I would like to claim that it was a masterful use of the blade.  But it was luck more than anything when my frantic swipe somehow knocked the wickedly barbed stinger away from me."
    
    "As the giant insect hung in the air and recovered from its failed attack, there was movement from the corner of my eye."
    
    kir "Hah!"
    
    "The bee's health rapidly decreased after Kirino passed it.  She landed lightly, her afterimage hanging in the air for a moment longer."
     
    "And as the bee flew unsteadily from that massive blow, a series of picks seemed to home in.  They all struck in a crescendo of steel."
    
    "Already low on health, the bee had no choice but to let out a death cry as its hp completely disappeared."
    
    kir "Did you see that?!  I hit the bee in midair!"
    
    kuro "So did I.  And I killed it too."
    
    "As Kirino snarled and stomped the ground angrily, I noticed that Kuroneko wasn't paying attention."
    
    "Instead, she was swiping her way through her inventory only to stop and press a spot in midair."
     
    "A weapon shimmered into view at her hip."
    
    "Curious, I leaned in to take a closer look. Only to jerk back in surprise as the tip nearly stabbed me."
    
    "As I looked up at her, Kuroneko had a grin on her face as she steadily pointed the giant needle at me.  With a twirl, she presented the worn handle toward me so that I could take it."
    
    "Now that I was holding it, I just needed a thought.  Then, almost like the information was pushed into my head, I knew that the weapon was..."
    
    kyo "...A blunt rapier?"
    
    kuro "I believe that I have found my weapon."
    
    # Scene Break
    
    "The three of us decided to stop in an area with hell boars that were around levels 4 to 5."
    
    "From my previous trips, as well as a friendly player that I found.  I knew that this area was empty of players because almost everyone was still safely within the walls of starter city."
    
    "Kuroneko was using her new weapon to slash the monsters repeatedly."
    
    "While she wasn't causing much damage, the weapon's light weight allowed her to attack over and over again without pause."
    
    "But it wasn't long before I noticed that her attack movements had changed from a flurry of slashes to a few direct thrusts."
    
    "Even though the boar almost had full health, it only took two or three attacks for it to die with the new attack pattern."
    
    "The next boar met the same fate."
    
    kuro "I see. Stabbing causes more damage..."
    
    "I turned back toward my own opponent, only to jump back as someone ran into view and carved a line down the boar's side."
    
    kir "Hah!"
    
    "As the boar died, a musical chime filled the air indicating that someone had just levelled up."
    
    kir "How's that?  I've levelled already!"
    
    kuro "That makes you level...3?"
    
    kir "4!  4!"
    
    "Kuroneko suddenly poked the boar that she had been fighting.  It squealed loudly before shattering.  Another chime sounded."
    
    kuro "Oho?  I do believe that I'm level 6 now."
    
    kir "..."
    
    kir "Flurry!"

    "Those two were really clearing the field."
    
    "Even factoring in the new spawns, over half of the field had been cleared already."
     
    "While the wolves themselves were dangerous because they would frequently band together in small groups before attacking."
    
    "Now that most of them were gone, that threat was almost nonexistent."
    
    kir "5!"
    
    "Kuroneko chose that moment to stab her opponent, causing it to die and shatter in a whimper.  She calmly turned to Kirino."
    
    kuro "Yawn.  I suppose that you want me to congratulate you?"
    
    kir "Ukiiii"
    
    "Those two have levelled far more quickly than I had expected.  I'm still trying to get past level 5 myself.  I turned to my next victim and raised my sword."
    
    kyo "Here we go!"
    
    "I barely leapt back in time when a dagger sliced past me."
    
    "Don't get in the way Aniki!"
    
    "I turned toward another wolf only to abruptly halt my charge as a black blur took but a moment to shatter it."
    
    "Sorry Nii-san."
    
    "Undaunted, I turned again."
    
    "Only to be rewarded by another shattering effect."
    
    "As the wolves continued dropping around us, I could only stand by and watch as the two went at it."
    
    "A warning chime filled the air."
    
    "That was the only warning that we had.  It was enough, as all three of us stopped and turned to stare at the massive creature that had just appeared."
    
    "Dire Wolf.  Level 8."
    
    "Towering over us, it had three health bars and an expression that suggested that we were dead."
    
    "And it was looking at me.  Ah what do you know.  The system really does know who is the weakest."
    
    kyo "Run!"
    
    "As I turned and tried to heed my own advice, I folded over and fell backward as a wolf minion rammed into me from below."
    
    "Quickly scrambling to my feet after that ungraceful fall.  I attacked the minion..."
    
    "...one hit..."
    
    "...two hits..."
    
    "I was thrown forward as something hit me hard from behind."
    
    "Rolling, I struggled to get up only to have another wolf leap onto me and snarl viciously at my face.  I punched and kicked at it as I fought desperately for my life."
    
    "That was when I felt myself tugged into the air.  My arm...it was tightly held within the confines of the Dire Wolf's massive jaws."
    
    "And then I felt the world blur and turn as the wolf proceeded to flail me back and forth before throwing me straight into the air with a mighty heave."
    
    "As the ground rushed toward me, I could only think of one thing.  This...was going to hurt."
    
    "Aniki!"
    
    "Kyosuke!"

    "Ugh."
    
    "I tried to close my eyes after having been brutally awoken from my sleep.  It was just a nightmare.  I could only imagine that it was a recount of yesterday."
    
    "It was true that we did encounter the wolf boss yesterday.  However, we ran for it as soon as we saw it appear."
    
    "Afterwards, Kirino was grumbling about how we could have defeated it..."
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    #About two hours later we were finishing breakfast when I thought of a question. “Kuroneko what kind of weapon do you use?” 
    #“I use these throwing knives” She replied as she pulled out the aforementioned knives.
    #“Doesn't it seem strange to use something other than melee weapons in a game all about melee combat?”  
    #“Why would I want to carry a big cumbersome weapon as someone of my stature? These knives fit me perfectly.” 
    #“Alright I suppose that makes sense.” Not really considering the fact that the only thing that makes it cumbersome is whether or not you have a high enough strength stat. “Well let's go out to the fields and start farming some boars. We need to start leveling up so we can hurry and get this game over with.” I said while offering my hand to Kirino who was still sitting down. At first I thought she was going to smack my hand a way, but after a second she gently took my hand. I pulled her up and let go of her hand but as I tried to move it back to my side she kept a hold of it. “Kirino?” I questioned, but she looked the other way a slight blush tinging her cheeks.
    
    
    # kirino and kuroneko get into a leveling competition.
    # kyousuke isn't able to keep up.
    # Both of them look disappointed.
    # I couldn't shake the bad feeling.
    
    # The next day, we were going through the forest.
    # 
    # I knew I was dead.
    # As my health dropped to zero, I could only watch helplessly as Kirino let out a scream before she was surrounded.
    # Kirino!
    #
    # That was when I woke up.
