    "I awoke to the wonderful feeling of a foot to the face. The foot just happened to belong to my oh so nice sister."
    
    kyo "That is not how you are supposed to wake someone."
    
    "I stood up while rubbing my cheek which had a comical foot mark across my cheek."
    
    kir "It is when that said someone convinced them to play a game that ended up ruining there middle school life."
    
    "Ouch. That caught me off guard, although I should have expected it after her being so unusually nice yesterday."
    
    "I sighed and opened my inventory and took out two large biscuits and a little bit of butter. I handed her one of the biscuits and the butter."
    
    kyo "Here is breakfast. Enjoy."
    
    "She stared at the biscuit as if she was convincing herself it was worth her time to chew on. Finally she scowled, spread some of the butter, and took a chunk of it in her mouth."
    
    "I simply watched her overdone actions as I started to tear into my own biscuit."
    
    
    kir "Here, take some too." 
    
    "I looked up in complete surprise. My mouth almost letting some of the biscuit fall out. She looked away still holding the butter out too me a slight blush tinging her cheeks."
     
    "My little sister can't be this cute. I stayed there for a minute before muttering my thanks and taking the proffered butter."
    
    kir "It's not like I felt bad or anything, I just did not want to get fat." 
    
    "She said trying to cover up her sweet actions."

    kyo "Right, like you can get fat in a game from eating." #I chuckled to myself.

    kir "What was that?"

    "Nothing." #I replied meekly. 
                                                                                                                                      
    "Groaning I got up off the floor"
    
    kyo "So, what do you want to do today. We could go fight monsters or we could go exploring. It's your choice."

    kir "Exploring. We can go see all the cute animals and plants in the forest." 
    
    "She jumped off the bed with a shine in her eyes after she said the words cute. Cute plants? How in the world plants could be cute I simply do not know and I just let it go that most of the supposed cute animals would probably end up being hostile."
    
    kyo "Okay then. Here." 
    
    "I opened the menu and sent her a party request as well as a friend request."
    
    kyo "Are you going to deny the party request again?"
    
    "I saw her stop right before she pressed the [[NO] button."
    
    kir "And what if I am?"
    
    kyo "Why don't you want to party?"
    
    kir "Because partying means..."

    "Now you may wonder how someone like me knows what the hell I am doing. Well after Kirino forcefully made me play some of her eroge I found my self playing a couple of different of mmorpgs. Plus reading the manual doesn't hurt."

    kyo "Alright then, let's head off." 
    
    "I opened the door and proceeded down the steps. Glancing back to make sure Kirino was following I made my way through the inn out into the busy streets."

    "I gave her a look, not that I was expecting it to work.  But for some odd reason, Kirino obediently let go and stalked off to the shade of the inn."
    
    "It was with a relieved look that the girl finally allocated the skill to tracking, but nothing happened. Stumped, I thought about it for a moment."

    "Huh?  No."
    
    kir "Let go of her right this instant."
    
    "That was probably the farthest thing from the truth.  While it was true that he was shielding her from view, it did not appear that he had a hold of her at all."

    "We both turned to him."

    # Kodaka scowls at the two for scaring Kobato.
    # Kirino scowls back
    # Kyosuke is trying not to cause trouble
    # Who gets the first word?  I think Kyosuke tries to pull Kirino away.
    # Kirino resists.  In fact, I think Kirino demands that the delinquent hand Kobato over.
    # Does Kirino duel?  Probably.  And I think she wins.
    # However, it's not a true duel as both combatants aren't aware of the dueling option.
    # Since they're in town, they are in a safe zone so there is a player HP protection system.
    # Kodaka loses the fight because he tries to brawl?
    # Kobato runs into the middle of the duel.  Kyosuke runs in too to protect her.  His heroic entrance where he flashes steel to deflect everything...fails.  He ends up bashed by a fist from one end and a sword from another.
    # It was a misunderstanding.
