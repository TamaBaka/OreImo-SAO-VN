    kir "Hey. I'm tired" # Kirino whined, drooping her shoulders and plopping down to the ground.
    kyo "How are you tired? We just did one quest. How are you going to be able to farm monsters in order to level up?" #I inquired quite seriously. 
    kir "Carry me." #She demanded while reaching her arms towards me. 

    "Just as I was about to refuse I thought of the possible consequences. I do not need to deal with an angry Kirino for the rest of the day."
    "I resigned myself to my fate and reached down and placed Kirino on my back." #As I did so Kirino blushed heavily and sputtered out 
    kir "Wh-what are you doing?"

    kyo "You're the one who asked for it. I am just complying with your demands."
    kir "You are not actually supposed to listen to me you know." 

    #She said while trying to hide her blushing face from me. There is not many things in the world that are cuter than a blushing Kirino. That is most definitely a fact. It just has to be.
    kyo "I was just being a nice brother and carrying his poor tired sister." 

    kir "No." 

    "She said while bopping my head."
    kyo "Ow. What was that for?"
    kir "Idiot." 

    "I just shook my head and continued walking down the road leading to the town. Drawing a couple of looks I smiled and waved."
    "While Kirino just clung tighter to my back and tried not to let anyone see her face. As we neared the city gates I could feel Kirino start to tense up and squirm a bit."
    "Do you want down?" #I asked thinking she was too embarrassed to stay on my back.
    kir "No. You're warm" #She said softly and 

    "I could feel her relax and lay her head on my shoulder. How my fiery sister can be so adorable at times just boggles the mind. Soon I could her light snores coming from my back."

    kyo "Of course the logical choice would be to go to sleep when someone is carrying you." #I muttered darkly to myself. 

    "Passing through the gates I headed to a nice little garden with some benches. I gently placed Kirino down on the bench."

    "The sun just happened to give her face a bit of a nice glow, as well as make a loose hair just call out to me."

    "Of course this calling must be answered so I bent over and gently brushed the hair aside."

    kyo "That's why you were a model. Just way too damned cute for your own good." 

    "I said as I leaned back into the bench. As I did so I thought I could see a slight smile form on Kirino's lips."

    "The warm sun that just happened to make Kirino look so pleasant sure did not want to feel pleasant as it pierced my eyes, so I closed my eyes for a couple of seconds to give them a rest."

    "?" "Wake up."

    "I felt something poke me."

    "I swatted away the offending object and turned my ahead the other way."

    kyo "ugh. In a minute"

    "Something poked me again."

    kir "I am hungry. Wake up"

    "Once again I swatted away the odd finger like object."

    kyo "I said give me minute. I am having a nice dream."

    kir "Isn't that nice? Having a pleasant dream while your poor sister is starving." 

    "An angry sounding voice said. Wait what is this falling feeling?"

    kyo "Wah! What the hell?"

    "I opened my eyes to see Kirino sitting on the bench with her arms crossed."

    kyo "Can't you ever wake me up normally?" #I said as I glared at her with as much annoyance as possible.
    kir "I tried that and all you did was slap my hand away." #She glared back at me with just as much annoyance.
    kyo "Oh. Well then. Sorry for yelling."

    kir "You should be it's dark and I am hungry." # 

    "I saw a a shiver go through her body and her eyes were darting to every dark corner in the garden. Wait a minute is she scared?"

    kyo "Okay let's go back to the inn and get something to eat"
    kir "Y-yes. Let's"  #She tried to say as another shiver came over her while she was rubbing her arms as she got up.
    kyo "Come here." #I told her as I opened my cloak since it was big enough to easily cover two people. 
    kir "W-what are you suggesting all of a sudden?"  #She asked as a deep crimson blush spread across her face.
    "Sigh."

    kyo "You are obviously cold. I don't want you coming down with the flu or something." #I said fully knowing you can't get sick. She just looked so sad shivering in the dark. 
    kir "Fine. Though it is just because I don't want to get sick." # She muttered as she wrapped part of the cloak around her and leaned against my side. I could feel a new warmth that spread through me.
    kyo "This feels oddly nice." # I muttered to myself. Surprising myself with my own words I blinked my eyes and hoped Kirino did not hear what I said.
    kir "Siscon" # She muttered as she closed her eyes and wrapped her arm in mine. She is just too unpredictable for me I swear. I shook my head to clear it of this odd happening and we began walking to the inn.

    "Our short trip back to the inn was rather uneventful. The only notable thing was that Kirino seemed to smile almost constantly when she thought I was not watching."        
    "A curious thing indeed, as that seemed to be last thing she would be doing in such a situation. She can be such an enigma sometimes I swear."
    
    #------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "As we neared the door and I was about to open the door Kirino practically shoved me away from her."

    kyo "Hey what gives? You didn't seem to have a problem clinging to me on the way here"
    kir "T-That was just so I wouldn't get sick. I was only holding onto your arm so I wouldn't get cold. It's not like I wanted to hold onto your arm or anything." 
    kir "Just hurry up and open the stupid door."
    kyo "Stupid door? What did it ever do to you?" #I quietly mused to myself as I complied and opened the door. 
    "The smell of cooking food instantly hit us as we stepped through the door."


    #------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    
    "Once again making sure Kirino was close we stepped outside the city. Looking out across the fields full of boars you could see a forest in the distance."
    
    kyo "It is quite a distance away." #I said gesturing towards the forest.

    kir "The problem is what exactly? I am young and in track, why would that matter? Plus we kind of don't have a curfew anymore." #Kirino replied with a bit of heat in her voice.

    kyo "Right. Sorry about that. Do you want to hunt any boars on the way?"

    kir "No. Let's just go to the forest. After all the cute things are waiting." #She passionately proclaimed. 
    
    "I just shook my head and started walking."

    #scene change
    "After about ten minutes of silent walking we came to the forest edge. Looking around as we entered I could see mostly pine trees with a couple of broad leaf trees scattered about."
    
    "The path we were on was pleasantly clear and well lit. Next to me Kirino's eyes were constantly darting around in order to spot her so called cute animals."

    "About a minute after entering the forest I heard some shuffling in the brush ahead of us. I put a hand on Kirino's shoulder stopping her and gesturing for her to be quiet."
    
    "As Kirino shuffled to my backside I withdrew my bastard sword. I dropped into what probably looked like a clich√© swordsman pose and patiently waited for what ever it was to show itself."
    
    "A few tense seconds later a wrinkly old man stumbled out of the clearing and fell towards us. Landing in a heap in front of us the old man croaked"
    
    "Old Man" "Help my grandchildren, they are trapped in my lodge back that way. I will give you all that I can in thanks." 
    
    "Briefly startled I looked above the mans head to find he had no marker identifying him as a player. Suddenly a window with a quest notification popped up in front of me."
    
    "Save the hermit's grandchildren was written across the top signifying this was indeed a quest."

    kyo "Well what do you say, should we do it?"

    kir "Of course we will. What person would refuse helping the poor man rescue his grandchildren?" #She exclaimed with utter disbelief.

    kyo "Kirino it is a quest. If we did not accept it then the next people who came through would probably accept it."

    kir "That is too much of an uncertainty. We must go save the kids." 
    
    "She forcefully pushed my finger onto the accept button and our party now had the quest under active quests."
    
    kir "Now onwards Little Sister Defense Squad."

    kyo "Wait. What did you just call us?" 
    
    "Did she just name our party the Little Sister Defense Squad? I must never let her find out about the guild creation process."
    

    "Watching the cloud of dust that used to be Kirino I broke out of my slack jawed trance and started up a fast jog to catch up to her."

    kyo "Good lord I hope she doesn't make the Npcs give her a harassment warning." #I said to no one in particular. 
    
    "Who knows what will happen if one of the kids is a young cute girl. I came upon a scene, that was honestly not too unexpected."
    
    "Kirino was savagely attacking a group of wolves that were obviously trying to get near the two children behind her back."
    
    "Wouldn't you know it? One of the kids was a young girl that looked to be around ten years old with short brown twin-tails held up by some shiny red ribbons."
    
    "The perfect little sister. I could just imagine Kirino was drooling like crazy."

    "Girl" "Oneechan save us." #The little girl said her voice shaky with fear, a couple of tears leaking out for added effect. 
    
    "Well that just put the topping on the cake. Kirino leaped forward bellowing out something about how little sisters were the center of the galaxy."
    
    "I could only stand there slightly dumbstruck at how she gracefully slid between the wolves."
    
    "Whittling their health down until one by one the wolves began to shatter into polygons."

    "As the last wolf fell Kirino happily exclaimed"
    
    kir "I did it. I saved the little sister." 
    
    "I frowned and gestured towards the boy."
    
    kir "Okay fine. I guess I saved the boy too." #She replied reluctantly. 
    
    "She instantly went and snuggled the little girl, seemingly without causing a harassment warning to pop up."
    
    "A few seconds passed with Kirino fawning of the girl, when I heard loud crashing coming from a section of the forest that seemed to be getting closer."
     
    "Turning towards the sound I leveled my sword and waited to see what came."

    "With a rushing sound and a loud crash a large white wolf appeared before us. At least eight feet tall it appeared to be something that was abnormally strong."
    
    kyo "A mini-boss perhaps?" #I mused to myself. 
    
    "I checked the icon over the wolf's head to read "Alpha Wolf" as well as a smaller symbol signifying this was a monster we had to defeat for the quest to finish."
    
    kyo "Well close enough. Kirino I will take care of this. I do not want you to fight with only a little more than half your health." 
    
    "Startled Kirino looked up at her health to find that it was indeed almost halfway gone. She nodded her head in confirmation and backed away with the children."

    "I stood a short distance away from the alpha and with my body tense with the excitement of fighting something new waited for the wolf to attack."
    
    "Without much warning other than a slight shift in its paws the wolf leaped towards me with speed only a game could produce."
    
    "I carefully waited and dashed to the side and brought my sword down onto the side of the wolf scoring a solid hit."
    
    "The recovery time of the wolf was surprisingly fast as I found my self battling the wolf for possession of my forearm."
    
    "The wolf's teeth embedded in my arm sent a numbing feeling to my brain that made me shudder slightly."
    
    "I brought the pommel of my sword down onto the wolf's nose causing it to yelp in simulated pain and release my arm."

    "There was an indicator showing that I was bleeding and would lose health until I used a bandage of some sort."
    
    "My health nearly a fourth of the way down and slowly decreasing, I took advantage of the slight stun caused by my hit to land a two handed blow directly to the wolfs head causing its health to fall into the red."
    
    "I twirled my sword until it faced down and brought the blade down into the back of the wolfs skull causing the last dregs of its health to fade away."
    
    "The wolf shattered leaving an inventory window behind."

    "Checking the window, there was about a thousand Col, a large cloak named Wolf's Mantle, and a couple of units of white wolf fur."
    
    "Grinning I opened my inventory and equipped my new cloak. I could instantly feel the warmth the cloak gave as well as the smooth feel of the fur around the neck.  I turned to Kirino."
    
    kyo "How do I look? Heroic?"

    kir "No. You look like someone who just defeated a lone alpha wolf and thinking he is the best player around." #She replied smartly, 
    
    "She quickly turning back to the young girl. After shooting her a frown I glanced at the hermit's lodge."
    
    "It really was not that bad looking, if anything it looked very well taken care of. A little fenced garden was planted off to the side as well as a tanning rack."

    kyo "Well let's head back to the hermit now to turn in the quest." 
    
    "I motioned for Kirino to follow.  Instead, she shook her head and hugged her victim tighter."

    kir "I don't want to." #She said back in a whiny voice while seemingly attached to the girl.

    kyo "If you do that to every young girl we meet you are going to get thrown in jail for harassment. Besides we need to turn in the quest for the experience and the much needed money."
    
    kyo "We do have to eat as well as sleep today." #I flatly pointed out.

    kir "Fine." #She angrily replied and 
    
    "When she sank into an adorable pout, I had to hold in my chuckles as we returned to the hermit."

    "Old man" "Oh thank you so much. You do not know what I would have done if they had been hurt." 
    
    "With that a window appeared showing quest complete in bold letters and the hermit returning to his lodge with the children."
    
    "Underneath it the reward was shown. Because there was only two of us, the loot was spread evenly."
    
    "Although there was only a monetary reward so we both ended up with five thousand Col."

    kyo "All right. Our first quest of the game done and some good loot to boot." #I exclaimed as 
    
    "I laughed at my own word play."

    kir "Yeah, let's go back to town. I am hungry." #She said while trying to sound annoyed, 
    
    "though I could see a slight smile on her lips as she turned towards the path back to town."


    #------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



    #Beep. Beep. Beep. Eh, that's odd I can't move to turn off the alarm. What is pinning my arms? I cracked my eyes open to see what was obstructing my movement to turn the now evil alarm off. Beep. Beep. Beep. My eyes snapped fully open when I saw the objects obstructing my arms. Both Kirino and Kuroneko were splayed out on top of me with their arms entwined with mine. Well. This is going to be a long morning. 
#‚ÄúBeep. Beep. Beep.‚Äù I imitated my alarm that was still going off to try and rouse them from their oh so peaceful sleep. Immediately Kirino managed to slip one of her arms out and smack me on the head. ‚ÄúOuch‚Äù How she could take an arm out and slip it back into place so quickly was just baffling. ‚ÄúHey you two get off of me. I'm going to go insane if I have to listen to this alarm for another minute.‚Äù
#Kirino made a mewing noise and shifted her arms a little. ‚ÄúHa, an opening.‚Äù I whispered as I tried to move my hand to the flashing button to turn off the alarm. This was not to be however, as I reached for the button Kirino's voice stopped me.
#‚ÄúOnii-chan, no don't leave me. Don't leave.‚Äù Kirino mewed in her sleep as she clung on to my arm. My arm immediately halted it's movement and was pulled back into her embrace. ‚ÄúNever leave me again. Onii-chan‚Äù
#My mind had to take a few moments to register what she said. ‚ÄúThat must be against the law somewhere.‚Äù I said to myself still trying to regain control of my limbs. ‚ÄúAt least Kuroneko is still asleep, she would never let Kirino live that one down‚Äù I said this as I turned my head to look straight into Kuroneko's lavender eyes.
#‚ÄúI wouldn't let her would I? Since you said so, I must not disappoint you nii-san.‚Äù She smiled mischievously making me wish I was somewhere not here. 
#‚ÄúG-Good morning Kuroneko.‚Äù I said rather weakly. Ah ha now I can finally turn the damned alarm off. However, as I went to move my hand to turn the alarm off Kuroneko began to pout and held my arm tightly.
#‚ÄúDon't leave me nii-san.‚Äù She said her voice quivering and tears forming in her eyes. What's with this face? It is too much for young man to handle. 
#‚ÄúAlright, fine you win. I won't get up but will you please for all that is holy let me turn off the alarm. I will go crazy if I have to hear it for another second.‚Äù I said sighing in defeat.
#‚ÄúFu fu. Sure nii-san‚Äù She said grinning in triumph. Finally I reached my arm out and turned off the alarm.
#‚ÄúAh. Finally my mind can re-Oi w-what do you think you are doing Kuroneko‚Äù I exclaimed turning beet red as Kuroneko nibbled on my ear.
#‚ÄúOh? You don't like that nii-san? You better take good care of us nii-san. Ku ku ku? She whispered into my ear biting down one last time before releasing my ear and going back to her original position.
#‚ÄúY-you shouldn't do such things unless it's with someone you care about‚Äù I sharply replied and turning the other way. 
#‚ÄúIdiot‚Äù As I looked over to see what she was talking about she was already back asleep gripping my arm just as strongly as before. Huh, I wonder what she meant by that?

#About two hours later we were finishing breakfast when I thought of a question. ‚ÄúKuroneko what kind of weapon do you use?‚Äù 
#‚ÄúI use these throwing knives‚Äù She replied as she pulled out the aforementioned knives.
#‚ÄúDoesn't it seem strange to use something other than melee weapons in a game all about melee combat?‚Äù  
#‚ÄúWhy would I want to carry a big cumbersome weapon as someone of my stature? These knives fit me perfectly.‚Äù 
#‚ÄúAlright I suppose that makes sense.‚Äù Not really considering the fact that the only thing that makes it cumbersome is whether or not you have a high enough strength stat. ‚ÄúWell let's go out to the fields and start farming some boars. We need to start leveling up so we can hurry and get this game over with.‚Äù I said while offering my hand to Kirino who was still sitting down. At first I thought she was going to smack my hand a way, but after a second she gently took my hand. I pulled her up and let go of her hand but as I tried to move it back to my side she kept a hold of it. ‚ÄúKirino?‚Äù I questioned, but she looked the other way a slight blush tinging her cheeks.
#‚ÄúAhh. Nii-san how unfair I want to hold your hand too.‚Äù Kuroneko whined as she grabbed my other hand causing Kirino to scowl for a split second and tighten her grip on my hand.
#‚ÄúUm. This is fine and all, but I can't open the door.‚Äù I said while we stood there staring at the unmoving door.
#‚ÄúStupid. Can't even open a door.‚Äù Kirino mumbled as she opened the door for us. We walked down the stairs into the main room causing many of the male patrons to stare at me with pure malice. I guess seeing a random guy with two adorable girls holding his hands would make anyone a little jealous. We continued across the room, exited the inn and began walking towards the city gates. Of course the whole time we attracted the ire of just about every male we passed.
#‚ÄúI guess cute girls playing these type of games really are a rarity.‚Äù I said thinking out loud not noticing the instant blushes on Kuroneko's and Kirino's faces. We passed through the gate with Kirino and Kuroneko both seemingly intrigued by what was on the ground and trailed behind me lightly holding my hand. To other people it probably looked like I was leading young children around by the hand.
#About 5 minutes or so passed and we finally reached the fields with the boars. ‚ÄúAlright Kirino, you and Kuroneko go out and start killing some boars. If we are lucky maybe we will level up. Don't forget to party up.‚Äù
#‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù Kirino asked questioningly.
#‚ÄúI can solo these things with my hefty bastard sword.‚Äù I grinned and pulled out my iron hand and a half sword. ‚ÄúA good mix between a one handed sword and a two handed sword. I will be fine alone. I promise.‚Äù
#‚ÄúAlright. If you say so.‚Äù Kirino said begrudgingly. Kirino then navigated her windows and sent Kuroneko an invite to her party. Seeing they were doing fine I walked a short distance away and looked for a boar. In the distance I could see several parties and soloists fighting boars as well. I suppose the people determined to beat the game would already be out farming but I didn't expect them to be this early. Wait. Who am I kidding? Of course they would be out already, this isn't a game anymore. If our health falls to zero then our brains will be turned into a freshly microwaved soup. I have to get stronger, strong enough to make sure Kirino can get out. No. I have to make sure Kirino and Kuroneko get out.
#As I was having my deep internal monologue, I failed to notice the not so small boar charging me until it rammed into me. This sent me rolling across the ground. Embarrassed I picked myself up off the ground and faced the boar who was still in the process of turning around. Looking at my hp I saw about three fourths remaining. ‚ÄúAlright. I just have to make sure it dies before it can hit me again.‚Äù I said full of confidence. Bringing my sword up I activated Horizontal. The system assist kicked in as I launched forward slicing a blue line along the body of the boar. The boar stumbled to a stop and attempted to turn around, but I had already activated Slant and slashed at the boars face depleting the remaining hp of the boar. Not realizing it should be dead, the boar tried to get up but its body swelled slightly then burst into white polygons signifying its death.  
#Hearing a small ding, a window appeared with the words ‚ÄúCongratulations You have Leveled Up‚Äù. Another window with my stats opened up asking me to allocate the newly acquired skill points. I threw two points into strength and three into agility. This caused my sword which only required 1 strength to instantly feel quite lighter. 
#I decided to take a look at how Kirino and Kuroneko were doing and was pleasantly surprised. They had already cleared a good section of the field and were continuing at a good pace. They seemed to work extremely well together. Kuroneko would attack first throwing several knives into a boar causing it to start towards her, then Kirino would rush up to it and halt its progress using her dagger allowing Kuroneko's knives to replenish. They would then finish off the boar. Doing this they quickly dispatched several more boars as I watched them.
#‚ÄúInteresting weapon choice, those throwing knives. Not many would choose that as it poses too much of a risk when you run out.‚Äù A voice mused next to me.
#‚ÄúAh! When did you get here?‚Äù I questioned as I fell to the side. Taking a look at the person who was quiet enough to sneak right up next to me. It was a girl shrouded in a hood, but I could make out shoulder length hair and some curious marks on her cheeks. They strangely reminded me of whiskers.
#‚ÄúOh, a minute or so ago? You know them?‚Äù 
#‚ÄúYeah. The one with the dagger is my sister and the one with the knives is one of our friends.‚Äù I replied slightly unnerved by her practically shining eyes as she leaned closer.
#‚ÄúOh so your sister and your girlfriend are her with you, how sweet.‚Äù She said semi-sarcastically.
#‚ÄúYeah, I feel kind of bad. I was the one who suggested playing SAO.‚Äù She stared at me for a minute then smirked. Wait what was she smiling for?
#‚ÄúOh so now I am your girlfriend? How presumptuous of you.‚Äù Kuroneko said grabbing onto my arm. Oh lord please don't let Kirino be here.
#‚ÄúYes aniki tell us all how you came to be a couple.‚Äù  Well damn. My day was going well.
#After a large and completely unnecessary incident in which I was thoroughly beaten down by Kirino and Kuroneko. We talked with the woman for a while finding out her name was Argo and that she was an information dealer.	
#As the sun was setting she left with ‚ÄúDon't forget, I will buy any info you get on people, mobs, areas, bosses. Anything really.‚Äù We each then got a request asking to accept her as a friend which we all did. 
#I turned to Kirino and Kuroneko and asked ‚ÄúAll right, so do we want to go back to the inn or fight more boars? Because it is almost night the spawn rates of the boars will go up and the players will probably thin out.‚Äù 
#‚ÄúStay.‚Äù They both immediately responded and began fighting the boars with even more vigor then before. They look like they are enjoying themselves. I smiled to myself and began sprinting towards a large group of the boars. 
#‚ÄúWe will beat this game.‚Äù I said to no one as I brought my sword down onto the head of a boar.
